# Teriffic Terps (Team IC25074) DOTS AI for Info Challenge 2025

## Challenge Background 
Across University of Maryland's campus, there are more than 50 parking areas, including parking garages, surface lots, meter spaces, and other parking structures. Each parking area has specific permissions that vary by time of day, community member, special events, and other considerations. Parking is regularly enforced on campus, with violations issued for 15 different violation types. 

During normal business hours (8AM - 4PM), DOTS (Department of Transportation Services) frequently fields customer inquiries around parking. This challenge aims to explore opportunities to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to the universityâ€™s unique parking environment. 

## Challenge
Permissions due to events, construction, and other special considerations, the department seeks to provide proof-of-concept in the application of existing AI and ML capabilities to the niche parking environment at UMD. The goal is to create an algorithm that will accurately indicate if customers are allowed to park in specific lots given various inputs. Some example inputs could include: customer type, permit permissions, date, time of day, and other fields. We are also interested in understanding the accuracy and error rates of proposed models. If the model is incorrect, customers risk receiving a parking violation from the university.
